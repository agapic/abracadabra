List of queries that will be used more or less for data analysis. <br>
Note that the context of 'before' refers to patch 5.11 whereas after refers to patch 5.14

#Magic Damage
Magic damage before/after [ranked: all regions, region specific], [normal: all regions, region specific]

#Win Rates

Win Rate before/after [ranked: all regions, region specific], [normal: all regions, region specific]

#Items
Note: there are 6 item slots and 16 AP items that underwent a change

Count the number of times that each of the 16 AP items appeared in each item slot before and after the patch<br>
[ranked: all regions, region specific], [normal: all regions, region specific]

Then, count the number of wins associated with each instance. From this, the application provides a good start as to how win rates were affected in each region/gametype based on item purchases.

Once this is done, champion specific data will be provided. But again, the crux of the application is based on items. Champion data is a big bonus.
